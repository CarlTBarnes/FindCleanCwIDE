; Enter one per line each of for your /ConfigDir=Path folders
; For Installs not in the Registry you run with "/ConfigDir" list those e.g. x:\Clarion10.12463\Bin\Settings

; End the Path with "\*" to load all sub folders containing: ClarionProperties.xml
; So if you organized all your Config Folders under one parent folder this makes it easy find them with 1 line
; You can test this with your C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\SoftVelocity\Clarion\*

; Can use DOS to find all sub folders with command: DIR /S /B ClarionProperties.xml > ConfigDIR.txt

; Limit testing to just Config tab by checking "Just This" and only these folders are scanned. 
; Put "JUST" on first line to check "Just This". 
; Put "END" on a line to stop loading the Config file.
